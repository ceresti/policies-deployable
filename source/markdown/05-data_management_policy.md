# 5. Data Management Policy

Ceresti utilizes the Aptible Backup Service to regularly backup electronic protected health information (ePHI).  The Aptible Backup Service ensures that complete, accurate, and retrievable backups are available for systems used by Ceresti to host customer ePHI.

Data backup is an important part of the day-to-day operations of Ceresti. To protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI, both for Ceresti and Ceresti customers, complete backups are done every 24 hours to assure that data remains available when it needed and in case of a disaster.

Violation of this policy and its procedures by employees may result in corrective disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
